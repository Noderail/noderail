# Who NodeRail Is For

NodeRail is built for anyone whose intellectual work needs to compound, not reset. Six use cases are documented here. Each describes a specific problem, how NodeRail addresses it, and what the outcome looks like.

## Researchers and Field Builders

**The problem:** A researcher develops a new methodology or interdisciplinary field. They publish papers, give talks, and build a following. But the core definitions, constructs, and governance of the field live in PDFs, slides, and their own head. When others try to build on the work, they start from scratch or misinterpret the foundations.

**How NodeRail helps:** NodeRail gives the field a structured home. The researcher publishes a Field node with a Field Constitution: scope, constructs, ethics, governance, and contribution standards. Every subsequent contribution is linked to this foundation. The field grows coherently, with attribution intact.

**The outcome:** A researcher can say: "Here is the canonical definition of this construct. Here is the version history. Here is the DOI. Build on it."

## Practitioners and Consultants

**The problem:** A consultant develops a powerful framework over years of client work. It lives in a deck. When they hand off a project or bring in a new team member, the framework gets reinterpreted, simplified, or lost. The next engagement starts from a weaker version.

**How NodeRail helps:** The consultant publishes the framework as a Framework node with canonical definitions, a version history, and a change log. When the framework evolves, the new version is linked to the old one with a `supersedes` relationship. The reasoning behind every change is preserved.

**The outcome:** A framework that survives handoffs, improves over time, and can be cited by clients and collaborators.

## Students and Early Researchers

**The problem:** A student completes a high-quality capstone project. It is assessed, graded, and filed. The next cohort works on a related problem, unaware the work was already done. The institution loses compounding value every semester.

**How NodeRail helps:** The student publishes their work as a Project node with a Continuation Hook: a required section that documents what was found, what was not resolved, and what the next person should build on. The node receives a DOI and becomes a citable artifact.

**The outcome:** Student work becomes institutional knowledge. The next cohort extends rather than restarts. The student has a citable publication.

## Universities and Research Centres

**The problem:** A university runs a research programme with cohort-based projects. Each cohort produces valuable work. None of it connects. The institution cannot demonstrate compounding value to funders, partners, or accreditors.

**How NodeRail helps:** NodeRail provides a continuity layer for the programme. Student projects are published as Project nodes linked to Field and Framework nodes. The programme can demonstrate a growing body of structured, citable knowledge that compounds across cohorts.

**The outcome:** A research programme that produces institutional knowledge, not just individual grades. A citable, versioned record of compounding intellectual work.

## Think Tanks and Policy Organisations

**The problem:** A policy organisation builds expertise over years. Staff rotate. When a senior analyst leaves, their frameworks, definitions, and reasoning leave with them. The organisation restarts from a weaker position every time it loses a key person.

**How NodeRail helps:** NodeRail makes institutional knowledge portable. Frameworks, definitions, and policy models are published as nodes with named stewards. When a steward leaves, stewardship is transferred. The knowledge stays.

**The outcome:** Institutional memory that survives staff turnover. A policy organisation that gets smarter over time, not just larger.

## Interdisciplinary Teams

**The problem:** A team spans multiple disciplines. Each discipline has its own vocabulary. The same word means different things to different team members. Decisions get made on incompatible assumptions. Alignment takes longer than the work itself.

**How NodeRail helps:** NodeRail's canonical definition system and `conflicts-with` link type make definitional conflicts visible and resolvable. Teams can publish a shared glossary as a Field node and link their work to it. Disagreements about definitions become explicit, not implicit.

**The outcome:** A team that can build on shared definitions rather than arguing about them. Faster alignment, cleaner handoffs, and a record of how the shared vocabulary evolved.
