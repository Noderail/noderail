# Request Access

NodeRail is in early access. The Request Access process exists to keep fields coherent, protect credit, and maintain safety standards during v0.1.

## Who Gets Approved Fastest

Access is prioritised for people who:

- Plan to publish a node soon (even a v0.1 draft)
- Want continuity — fork, extend, or adopt — with credit-safe lineage
- Are aligned with a dignity-first, non-surveillance stance on capacity data

## What We Ask

Use the **Request Access** form to submit the following:

- Your name, email, and role
- What you are publishing first (Field, Framework, Measurement, or Project)
- A one-paragraph description and your evidence intent
- A safety affirmation confirming your work will not be used for surveillance or punishment

Access is not a gate — it is a handshake. If you are building something that strengthens continuity, lineage, or compounding, you belong here.
