# What is NodeRail?

NodeRail is **versioned knowledge infrastructure**. It is a system for publishing, linking, and preserving intellectual work in structured units called nodes, each with a permanent identifier, a version history, and an explicit lineage back to its origin.

## The Direct Answer

Most tools store documents. NodeRail stores **intellectual continuity**: the property that allows a body of work to be extended, built upon, and cited over time without losing its definitions, authorship, or lineage.

NodeRail is not a wiki, a note-taking app, a research database, or a CMS. It is infrastructure for fields, frameworks, measurements, and projects that need to compound rather than restart.

## What NodeRail Is Not

Understanding what NodeRail is not helps clarify what it is:

| What people compare it to | Why it is different |
|---|---|
| **A wiki** | Wikis store text. NodeRail stores structured nodes with version lineage, DOI citation, governance metadata, and explicit links between concepts. A wiki page has no lineage, no canonical definition system, and no DOI. |
| **A knowledge management tool** | KM tools organise information for retrieval. NodeRail organises intellectual work for continuity: the ability to extend, build upon, and cite work over time without losing its lineage. The difference is between storage and compounding. |
| **A research database** | Research databases index existing published work. NodeRail is infrastructure for creating and publishing that work in the first place, with continuity built in from day one. |
| **A documentation platform** | Documentation platforms record what was done. NodeRail records the intellectual structure behind what was done: definitions, constructs, relationships, and the reasoning that connects them. |
| **A repository (GitHub)** | Repositories version code and files. NodeRail versions intellectual units with structured metadata, canonical definitions, governance, and citation capability. |

## The Core Concept: Intellectual Continuity

**Intellectual continuity** is the property of a body of knowledge that allows it to be extended, built upon, and cited over time without losing its lineage, definitions, or authorship trail.

Intellectual continuity fails when:

- A term's meaning shifts gradually without anyone tracking it (**concept drift**)
- Work accumulates faster than it gets documented (**documentation debt**)
- Critical knowledge lives only in one person's head (**founder dependency**)
- The same construct gets defined differently in different documents (**duplicate definitions**)
- Documents exist but are no longer maintained or trusted (**dead docs**)

NodeRail is designed to prevent all five of these failure modes.

## What NodeRail Provides

NodeRail gives every piece of intellectual work three things that no other platform currently combines:

**1. Permanent DOIs and Citation**
Every node version receives a permanent Digital Object Identifier via Zenodo integration. Work becomes a citable academic artifact, not a link that breaks.

**2. Git-Based Lineage Tracking**
Every contribution is timestamped and version-controlled. Fork, extend, or adopt any node while preserving a complete, auditable lineage back to the origin.

**3. Structured Node Architecture**
Fields, Frameworks, Measurements, and Projects are structured units, not freeform documents. They connect through citations and lineage, so progress compounds.

## Who NodeRail Is For

NodeRail is built for anyone whose intellectual work needs to compound, not reset:

- **Researchers and field builders** who need a citable, versioned home for their methodology
- **Practitioners and consultants** who need frameworks that survive handoffs
- **Students and early researchers** who want capstone work to become citable infrastructure
- **Universities and research centres** that need student work to compound across cohorts
- **Think tanks and policy organisations** that need institutional memory to survive staff turnover

## The NodeRail Vocabulary

NodeRail introduces a small set of precise terms. Understanding them makes the platform immediately clear:

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Node** | A structured, citable unit of intellectual work |
| **Field** | A node type that defines the scope, constructs, ethics, and governance of a domain of knowledge |
| **Lineage** | The traceable chain of versions and relationships from a node back to its origin |
| **Canonical definition** | The authoritative, versioned definition of a term or construct, with an owner and a change log |
| **Stewardship** | The responsibility for maintaining and governing a node over time |
| **Continuity debt** | The accumulated gap between the intellectual work that has been done and the work that has been properly documented, versioned, and linked |

For the full vocabulary, see the [NodeRail Glossary](/).
