# NodeRail

## A home for frameworks, measurements, and student projects — built for citation, lineage, and continuity.

**Publish nodes. Fork progress. Preserve credit.**

---

Most knowledge work gets lost or fragmented because it is stored in the wrong containers. Frameworks get posted as content and vanish into the feed. Measurements live inside PDFs and slide decks with no lineage. New fields have no canonical home or source of truth. Student research dies after grading — massive intellectual waste. Credit gets lost: contributors are not consistently attributed when work is extended. Continuity breaks: there is no clean way to fork, adopt, or extend without erasing origin.

**NodeRail exists to make progress compounding possible — through citation, lineage, and continuity.**

## What is a Node?

A **node** is a structured unit of intellectual work that can be cited, versioned, linked to other nodes, adopted, forked, extended, and attributed via lineage. NodeRail currently supports four node types:

| Node Type | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Field** | Defines a field: scope, constructs, ethics, governance, and a constitution for contributions |
| **Framework** | A reusable method, model, or operational playbook inside a field |
| **Measurement** | An instrument, index, or scale for measuring a construct inside a field |
| **Project** | A student project, capstone, case study, replication, or pilot with a required Continuation Hook |

Nodes connect through citations and lineage, so others can continue your work without erasing where it came from.

## How NodeRail Works

1. Create a **Field** — define scope, constructs, ethics, and governance.
2. Publish **Nodes** inside it — frameworks, measurements, student projects.
3. Continue work via **fork / adopt / extend** — with lineage preserved.
4. Attach proof — case studies, pilots, replications.
5. Credit is preserved automatically through **lineage + citations**.

## Founder Field

**Human Capacity Science (HCS)** is the first Founder Field on NodeRail, created and maintained by Gao. HCS is the measurement and design of cognitive, emotional, and digital load so capacity does not silently degrade until it becomes burnout, errors, or disengagement.

> NodeRail supports any field. HCS is the first.
