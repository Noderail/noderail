# Templates

Templates are platform-owned starters. They reduce friction and standardise structure across all nodes on NodeRail.

Every template includes a lineage header block so that credit, version, and origin are captured from the moment a node is created.

---

| Template | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Field Constitution](/template-field-constitution) | Define a new field: scope, constructs, ethics, governance, and registries |
| [Framework Node](/template-framework-node) | Publish a reusable method, model, or operational playbook |
| [Measurement Node](/template-measurement-node) | Publish an instrument, index, or scale for measuring a construct |
| [Project Node](/template-project-node) | Publish a student project, capstone, case study, replication, or pilot |

---

> All templates are versioned. If you adapt a template, note the version you started from in your node's lineage block.
