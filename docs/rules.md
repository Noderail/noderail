# Rules v0.1

NodeRail is an open infrastructure, but it is not a free-for-all. The rules below exist to protect credit, continuity, and dignity — the three things that make intellectual work compound rather than disappear.

---

## Field Creation

**Field creation is open. Recognition is earned.** Anyone can create a Draft Field. Fields earn Recognised status through demonstrated structure and evidence — not by application or payment.

## Credit and Lineage

**Credit and lineage are non-negotiable.** Every node preserves authorship, history, and fork relationships. Extensions do not erase origins. Lineage is explicit and permanent.

## Evidence Standards

**Evidence is labelled, not censored.** Work carries evidence badges (Draft → Validated) and can be marked Contested when there is substantive disagreement. Nothing is removed for being early-stage.

## What Is Not Allowed

The following uses are prohibited on NodeRail:

- Surveillance or non-consensual tracking of individuals
- Use of capacity data for punishment or discipline
- Discrimination in any form
- Plagiarism or false attribution
- Spam or low-effort submissions designed to game lineage

## Ownership

Field creators own and govern their fields. NodeRail maintains platform templates and enforces attribution and safety standards. The platform does not claim ownership over any node content.
