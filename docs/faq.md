# Frequently Asked Questions

Direct answers to the most common questions about NodeRail.

---

## What is NodeRail?

NodeRail is versioned knowledge infrastructure. It gives researchers, practitioners, and students a permanent, citable home for their intellectual work, with DOI versioning, Git-based lineage tracking, and academic citation built in.

For a full explanation, see [What is NodeRail?](/what-is-noderail).

---

## What problem does NodeRail solve?

NodeRail solves intellectual continuity failure: the pattern where ideas, definitions, frameworks, and research get lost, duplicated, or fragmented across tools, teams, and time. It provides structured, versioned, citable infrastructure so intellectual work compounds instead of restarting.

The nine specific failure modes NodeRail addresses are documented in the [Problem Index](/problem-index).

---

## How is NodeRail different from a wiki?

Wikis store text. NodeRail stores structured intellectual units (nodes) with version lineage, DOI citation, governance metadata, and explicit links between concepts. Every node is citable, forkable, and traceable to its origin. A wiki page has no lineage, no canonical definition system, and no DOI.

---

## How is NodeRail different from a knowledge management tool?

Knowledge management tools organise information for retrieval. NodeRail organises intellectual work for continuity: the ability to extend, build upon, and cite work over time without losing its lineage. The difference is between storage and compounding.

---

## How is NodeRail different from GitHub?

GitHub versions code and files. NodeRail versions intellectual units with structured metadata, canonical definitions, governance, and citation capability. NodeRail uses Git as its underlying version control mechanism, but it is not a code repository. It is infrastructure for ideas, frameworks, and research.

---

## What is intellectual continuity?

Intellectual continuity is the property of a body of knowledge that allows it to be extended, built upon, and cited over time without losing its lineage, definitions, or authorship trail. It is the opposite of documentation debt, concept drift, and knowledge fragmentation.

See the [Glossary](/glossary) for a full definition and related terms.

## Who should use NodeRail?

NodeRail is built for:

- **Researchers and field builders** who need a citable, versioned home for their methodology
- **Practitioners and consultants** who need frameworks that survive handoffs
- **Students and early researchers** who want capstone work to become citable infrastructure
- **Universities and research centres** that need student work to compound across cohorts
- **Think tanks and policy organisations** that need institutional memory to survive staff turnover

---

## Can students use NodeRail for capstone projects?

Yes. The Project node type is specifically designed for student capstones, applied research, and pilots. Each project node includes a Continuation Hook: a required section that documents what the next person should build on. This turns a one-time project into a compounding contribution.

---

## What is a DOI and why does it matter?

A DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is a permanent identifier for a digital object. Unlike a URL, a DOI never breaks. When a node receives a DOI, it becomes permanently citable: anyone can reference it in academic papers, reports, or other work, and the reference will always resolve.

NodeRail issues DOIs through Zenodo, an open-access repository operated by CERN.

---

## What are the four node types?

| Node Type | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Field** | Defines a field: scope, constructs, ethics, governance, and a constitution for contributions |
| **Framework** | A reusable method, model, or operational playbook inside a field |
| **Measurement** | An instrument, index, or scale for measuring a construct inside a field |
| **Project** | A student project, capstone, case study, replication, or pilot with a required Continuation Hook |

## Is NodeRail free?

NodeRail v0.1 is in early access. Submit a request and Gao Kabubi will review it personally. Pricing and access tiers will be announced with v0.2.

## How do I get access?

Submit a request via the [Request Access](/access) page. The process takes less than five minutes. Access is not a gate — it is a handshake.

---

## What is the NodeRail Continuity Standard?

The NodeRail Continuity Standard v0.1 defines the minimum requirements for a piece of intellectual work to be considered continuity-grade. It covers six requirements: node metadata, canonical definitions, version lineage, change logs, link relations, and stewardship.
