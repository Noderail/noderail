# How NodeRail Works

NodeRail is infrastructure for intellectual work to compound instead of disappearing. Every meaningful artifact is treated as a **Node** — a structured unit of work that can be cited, versioned, linked, adopted, forked, extended, and attributed via lineage.

## Node Types

| Node Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Field Node** | Defines scope, constructs, ethics, and governance. Contains registries of frameworks, measurements, and projects. |
| **Framework Node** | A reusable model or playbook inside a field. |
| **Measurement Node** | An instrument, index, or scale inside a field. |
| **Project Node** | A capstone, research project, case study, replication, or pilot — with a required **Continuation Hook**. |

## Lanes

Every node lives in one of two lanes:

- **Experimental** (default) — open contributions and early-stage work.
- **Official** — endorsed by the field Maintainer or Stewards.

---

## Evidence Badges

All nodes carry an evidence badge to communicate their validation status:

> **Draft → Pilot → Validated → Contested → Deprecated**

---

## Continuity Actions

NodeRail is designed for continuity. Three actions allow work to grow without erasing its origin:

- **Fork** — branch a node while preserving full lineage back to the original.
- **Adopt** — transfer maintainership while keeping credit intact.
- **Extend** — add modules or components without rewriting the original node.

## Lineage Metadata

Every node carries lineage metadata so credit is never lost:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Origin node` | The node this work derives from |
| `Forked from` | The specific node version forked |
| `Adapted from` | Source of adaptation |
| `Extended by` | Nodes that extend this one |
| `Maintainer` | Current steward |
| `Contributors` | All named contributors |
| `Cite as` | Citation block for academic or professional use |
| `Version` | Current version |
| `Changelog` | History of changes |
