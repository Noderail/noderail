## Why This Field Exists

We are entering an era where human performance is constrained less by raw intelligence and more by **capacity** — the ability to sustain clarity, focus, recovery, and execution under constant switching, digital overload, and ambient stress.

Yet most systems measure outcomes *after* capacity has already degraded: missed deadlines, errors, disengagement, burnout, churn. Human Capacity Science exists to make capacity **measurable, designable, and protectable** — before breakdown becomes visible.

---

## Core Definition (v0.1)

**Human Capacity Science** is the study and design of how individuals and teams maintain usable cognitive and emotional bandwidth over time — especially under modern work conditions shaped by digital overload, context switching, and incomplete recovery.

---

## What HCS Studies (v0.1)

HCS focuses on six interconnected areas:

| Area | Description |
|---|---|
| **Capacity erosion** | How usable bandwidth decays over a day or week |
| **Attention residue / meeting carryover** | How unfinished context persists and degrades performance |
| **Switching friction** | Costs of task switching and tool switching |
| **Recovery loops** | Micro and macro recovery patterns |
| **Intervention design** | What actually restores capacity, not just motivates action |
| **Privacy-first measurement** | Measurement without surveillance |

---

## Scope

| | |
|---|---|
| **In-scope** | Capacity measurement, attention residue and carryover, cognitive load, digital fatigue, recovery design, intervention timing, dignity-first telemetry |
| **Out-of-scope** | Surveillance for discipline, productivity extraction, medical diagnosis |
| **Not this** | Generic wellness content, motivation coaching, or a productivity ideology |

---

## Key Terms (Working Vocabulary)

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Capacity** | Usable bandwidth for high-quality thinking and execution |
| **Bandwidth** | The felt and functional availability of attention and regulation at a given moment |
| **Capacity erosion** | Progressive decline in usable bandwidth caused by overload, switching, and incomplete recovery |
| **Carryover / attention residue** | Lingering cognitive and emotional load from previous tasks or meetings |
| **Reset** | An intervention that reduces residue and restores bandwidth (micro, meso, and macro resets) |

---

## Measurement Philosophy

HCS measurements should be:

- **Privacy-first** — no covert or passive collection
- **Actionable** — they should point to interventions, not just scores
- **Non-punitive** — not weaponised against individuals
- **Context-aware** — capacity depends on environment and demands
- **Transparent** — explainable, not opaque scoring

---

## Ethics and Safety (Non-Negotiables)

- No covert monitoring.
- No ranking people as "good" or "bad" humans.
- No selling capacity scores to employers for punishment.
- Default to consent, transparency, and user control.
- Prefer interventions that increase agency rather than coercion.

See [Ethics Charter](/hcs/ethics) for full platform-wide norms.

## NodeRail Connection

This field is published on NodeRail to ensure:

- **Continuity** — work can be extended, not repeated from scratch
- **Lineage** — credit is preserved as nodes evolve
- **Canonical structure** — constructs, measurements, frameworks, and projects stay connected

---

## How to Contribute to HCS (v0.1)

You can contribute by publishing a node under this field:

| Node Type | What to publish |
|---|---|
| **Framework Node** | A method, model, or operational workflow |
| **Measurement Node** | A construct + scoring method + intended use + safeguards |
| **Project Node** | Student research, applied pilots, prototypes, or case studies |

Use the templates: [Framework Node](/template-framework-node) · [Measurement Node](/template-measurement-node) · [Project Node](/template-project-node)

---

## Founder Notes

This field began because the infrastructure to build credibility and continuity for emerging, interdisciplinary fields like HCS did not exist in a usable form. Academic journals are too slow and too closed. LinkedIn posts vanish. PDFs have no lineage. NodeRail is part of the response: a place where the work can compound publicly with attribution.

---

## v0.1 Roadmap (Field-Level)

The next steps for HCS on NodeRail are:

1. Publish an initial construct map (core constructs and relationships)
2. Publish the first measurement node (bandwidth / capacity proxy)
3. Publish 1–2 frameworks for intervention design and capacity recovery
4. Publish a student-project pathway (how student work becomes nodes)
5. Define a contribution standard for "field-quality" vs "draft nodes"
