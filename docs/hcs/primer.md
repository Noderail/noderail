# HCS Primer v0.1

Human Capacity Science (HCS) is a field dedicated to the measurement and design of cognitive, emotional, and digital load. Its central premise is that capacity — the human ability to think, decide, create, and connect — degrades silently and systematically in modern work environments, and that this degradation is measurable, designable, and preventable.

## Why HCS Exists

Most organisations treat performance problems as motivation problems. When people slow down, make errors, or disengage, the default response is to push harder, add more training, or change the person. HCS challenges this assumption. It argues that the more common root cause is **capacity degradation** — a measurable reduction in the cognitive, emotional, and attentional resources available to a person at a given moment.

HCS exists to give researchers, designers, and practitioners the constructs, measurements, and frameworks to diagnose capacity problems accurately and intervene with dignity.

## The Core Insight

> When people fail, check capacity before character.

Capacity is not fixed. It is consumed by cognitive load, depleted by emotional residue, and fragmented by digital environments. It is also restorable — through recovery design, intervention timing, and environment change. HCS is the science of understanding and managing this cycle.

## What HCS Is Not

HCS is not a productivity optimisation framework. It is not a surveillance system. It is not a wellness content category. It is a rigorous, dignity-first field of measurement and design that treats human capacity as a resource to be understood and protected — not extracted.

## The Field in v0.1

In v0.1, HCS defines four core constructs (Cognitive Load, Emotional Residue, Digital Load, Recovery), establishes an ethics charter, and publishes its first frameworks and measurements as open nodes on NodeRail. All work is versioned, attributed, and open for extension.
