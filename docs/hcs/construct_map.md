# HCS Construct Map v0.1

The construct map defines the core measurable concepts in Human Capacity Science. Each construct has a definition, observable signals, and known outcomes when the construct is under strain.

---

| Construct | What it is | Signals (examples) | Outcomes when strained |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cognitive Load** | Working-memory and decision strain | Task switching, restart loops, decision fatigue | Errors, slowdowns, avoidance |
| **Emotional Residue** | Carryover affect and attention from prior contexts | Post-meeting friction, rumination, irritability | Avoidance, interpersonal conflict, reduced focus |
| **Digital Load** | Stimulation and fragmentation pressure from tool and notification environments | Notification volume, tab chaos, app-switching | Fatigue, reduced deep work, attention fragmentation |
| **Recovery** | Reset capability and access to micro, mid, and macro resets | Micro-break uptake, sleep quality, transition rituals | Sustained performance when present; degradation when absent |

## Notes on v0.1

This construct map is a starting point, not a final taxonomy. New constructs can be proposed as Framework or Measurement Nodes and linked back to this map via lineage. The map will be versioned as the field evolves.
