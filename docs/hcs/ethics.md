# HCS Ethics Charter v0.1

Human Capacity Science works with sensitive data about human cognitive and emotional states. The following principles are non-negotiable and apply to all nodes published under the HCS field.

## The Six Principles

**No punishment use.** Capacity data must never be used for discipline, performance management, or any form of punitive action. Capacity measurement is a support tool, not a surveillance tool.

**Consent is mandatory.** All data collection must be opt-in, clearly explained, and understandable to the person being measured. Passive or covert collection is prohibited.

**Minimum viable data.** Collect only what is necessary to answer the specific question at hand. Do not collect capacity data speculatively or for undefined future use.

**User ownership.** Individuals whose data is collected retain the right to export and delete their data at any time, without penalty.

**Transparency.** All rules, use cases, and data practices must be documented and accessible. No hidden logic, no opaque scoring.

**Dignity over optimisation.** The goal of HCS is to support human capacity, not to extract maximum output. Any intervention or measurement that creates coercion, anxiety, or dehumanisation is out of scope.

> These principles apply to all HCS nodes regardless of lane (Experimental or Official) or evidence status.
