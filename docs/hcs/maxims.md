# The 10 HCS Maxims

These maxims are the operating principles of Human Capacity Science. They are not motivational slogans — they are diagnostic and design heuristics for practitioners working with human capacity.

---

1. When people "fail," check capacity before character.
2. Motivation is fragile; ability is buildable.
3. Friction is the real opportunity.
4. Attention is a resource. Context-switching spends it fast.
5. Open loops are cognitive debt.
6. Emotional residue is real — and it travels.
7. We don't burn out from hard work; we burn out from unrecovered work.
8. The best intervention fits inside the day people actually have.
9. Measure load early, or you'll treat symptoms late.
10. Design for dignity: capacity support must never become surveillance.
